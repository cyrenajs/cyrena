## Introduction

Powercycle is an extension built upon the wonderful framework, Cycle.js. It adds the capabilities of stream-based VDOM composition, seamless React integration with Cycle state, and many more fun features. It removes the usual boilerplates Cycle.js has, and the mental obstacles which new-learners face. Any regular Cycle.js component can be included in a Powercycle app. Powercycle currently only supports the React VDOM driver.

## Installation

Install powercycle and its peer dependencies:

`npm install powercycle @cycle/react react xstream`

Install the usual Cycle/react dependencies:

`npm install @cycle/run @cycle/react-dom @cycle/state`
